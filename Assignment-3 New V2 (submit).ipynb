This speaks volumes about its thermal management system, a big factor when it comes to high-performance gaming laptops that house top-of-the-line hardware inside laptop chassis which have very little room to manage heat in comparison to gaming desktops. However, you should also keep in mind that this is one heavy laptop (3.3 kg) and its not meant to be carried around frequently. The MSI Titan is also heavy on your wallet and that\\'s also the reason why we have suggested lesser-priced high-performance gaming laptops below in the list to suit slightly lower budgets.

The 150W TGP rating of the GPU ensures unshackled performance across the most demanding games with Ray Tracing turned on. Besides performance (which you can find in detail from the video below), the other two areas that left us mighty impressed are thermal management and display quality.

With an 18-inch display the ASUS ROG Strix Scar 18 (that\\'s a mouthful), should be your weapon of choice, especially if you are on the lookout for a performance machine with an Nvidia RTX 4080 under the hood. The blazing fast GPU is well accompanied by a 13th Gen Intel Core i9 HX series processor and 32GB of RAM. Your games will not only run at butter-smooth frame rates, they will also load faster with 32GB of DDR5 memory rated at 4800MHz. The large 18-inch display allowed ASUS some additional room inside the chassis, as a result, while the laptop has a large footprint, it\\'s not excessively thick or heavy for an 18-inch top specced gaming laptop. Our only possible crib against the laptop is the display resolution which is limited to FHD+ (1920 x 1200) on this particular model. So you will be a bit short of the 1440p standard which is considered as the sweet spot, given the GeForce RTX 4080 under the hood.\\nMORE SPECIFICATIONS\\nProcessor : 13th Gen Intel Core i9-13980HX 24 core processor with 2.2 GHz clock speed\\nDisplay : 18″ (1920 x 1200) screen, 165 Hz refresh rate\\nOS : Windows 11 Home\\nMemory : 32 GB DDR5GB RAM & 1 TB SSD\\nGraphics Processor : 12 GB DDR6 NVIDIA GeForce RTX 4080 Graphics card\\nBody : 294 x 399 x 23 mm dimension & 3.1 kg weight\\nPrice : ₹ 279,990\\nAVAILABLE ₹ 279990\\nBUY NOW',\n",
